    This is VimCommander, a two-panel file-manager for vim.

    Upon entrance, the two panels are presented. Operations are performed by
    default from one panel to the other.

    File selection is implemented also, see |vimcommander-keys| for the
    keyboard shortcuts.

    See also |vimcommander-links| for more information on this kind of
    file-manager.

==============================================================================
4. VimCommander Keys                                       *vimcommander-keys*

    Most of VimCommander's key-bindings are similar to the other
    commanders':

    - TAB       = Go to the other panel.
    - F3        = View file under cursor.
    - F4        = Edit file under cursor.
    - F5        = Copy file.
    - F6        = Move/rename file.
    - F7        = Create directory.
    - F8/DEL    = Remove file.
    - F9        = SSH connect
    - F10       = Quit VimCommander.
    - C-R       = Refresh panels.
    - Backspace = Go to parent directory.
    - C-U       = Exchange panels.
    - C-Left    = Put directory under cursor on other panel, or grab
                  other panel's dir.
    - C-Right   = Same.
    - \H        = Show hidden files (toggle).
    - INS       = Select file under cursor.
    - "+"       = Select file by pattern.
    - "-"       = De-select file by pattern.
    - S-F4      = Edit new file.
    - C-t       = Previous directory.
    - C-y       = Next directory.

    C-* stands for CTRL+*. S-* stands for SHIFT+*.
    As some terminals do not support SHIFT/CTRL+non-letter-keys, a <leader>
    version has usually been provided.
    So, <leader>Right and C-Right are the same.
    Same for M-keys, including letters.

    User can redefine keys (in VimCommander's buffer) by adding them in a
    ~/.vimcommander.custom file using the existing |vimcommander-key-hooks|.

    For example to remap the select action to the 't' key just add

        nmap <buffer> t   <Plug>VimCommanderSelect

    to the .vimcommander.custom file
